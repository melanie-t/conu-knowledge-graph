Environmental geology is concerned with the physical, chemical, and biological processes that have acted, and continue to act, upon the planet, shaping its evolution. The course examines the interactions of lithosphere, mantle, core, biosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere. The Earth’s climate is in part determined by these Earth system interactions, and climate change throughout the Earth’s history is a central theme of the course."
GEOL 204 "Natural Disasters" "This course introduces students to natural disasters. Students gain an understanding of the geological and meteorological environments of the world that allow humans to plan for avoidance and mitigation of disasters. Topics may include plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, landslides and mudslides, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, ice storms, thunderstorms, and tornadoes."
GEOL 206 "Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Plate Tectonics" "This course is for students with little or no previous background in the earth sciences, providing an up-to-date account of our present knowledge of earthquakes and volcanoes, and the use of this information in the development of the theory of plate tectonics. Areas of concentration are: nature, distribution, and causes of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, measuring earthquakes, great earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in world history, products of volcanic eruptions, and hazards from, and prediction of, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The theory of plate tectonics and the evolution of mountain belts of the world are studied. Lectures only."
GEOL 208 "The Earth, Moon and the Planets" "The course emphasizes the cosmic perspective of the Earth and focuses attention on how the results of the last two decades of planetary exploration have brought about an intellectual revolution concerning the planets, especially their surface features, processes, and histories.

GEOL 210 "Introduction to the Earth" "This course provides an overview of the physical processes that govern how the Earth works. Topics include origin of the solar system and Earth; analysis of the internal structure of the Earth; minerals and rocks; igneous and metamorphic processes; deformation of the crust; surficial processes, including weathering, deposition and glaciation. The course culminates with the integration of these geological processes in the theory of plate tectonics, and goes on to examine the interactions of crust, mantle, atmosphere, and biosphere from this perspective. Laboratory work includes the identification of rocks and minerals, map exercises, and a field trip. Lectures and laboratory."
GEOL 216 "Field Methods" "Prerequisite: GEOL 210. The purpose of this course is twofold: to learn the basic methods that geologists, physical geographers, and environmental scientists use in the field (including learning how to map, measuring stratigraphic sections, and solving field problems based on observations) and to become familiar with the immediate geological environment of the Montreal region from the young Quaternary sediments, Mesozoic intrusive rocks and Paleozoic assemblages (including rocks of the St. Lawrence Lowlands) to the ancient Precambrian, crystalline basement. Two-week field school in the spring, immediately after the final examination."

Key themes include state formation and post-civil war politics; Fianna Fáil and “the republicanization” of society; church and state; Irish neutrality and Anglo-Irish relations; the political and social character of “De Valera’s Ireland”; post-war economic and social change; external relations and influences; the Republic’s responses to Northern Ireland and the post-1968 Troubles; globalization and the rise and fall of the Celtic Tiger economy."
IRST 315 "The Troubles in Northern Ireland " "After surveying the historical roots of the divisions in Northern Irish society, the course traces the successive phases of the prolonged “Troubles” (1968 to 1998): the Catholic civil rights movement; the period of armed conflict between the IRA, loyalist paramilitaries, and security forces; and the recent peace process, as well as post-conflict issues including power-sharing, peace and reconciliation, and constitutional change. Attention is also given to cultural expressions of the Troubles and its legacies."

IRST 333 "The Irish Language and its Culture II " "Prerequisite: IRST 233; MIRI 290; or permission of the School. Under pressure for over 200 years from the expanding use of English, Irish is still considered by many a crucial underpinning of Irish national identity. This course assumes elementary knowledge of the Irish language as a platform for students to access cultural forms (memoirs, poetry, short stories, sean-nós songs, films) and media such as radio, newspapers, television, and podcasts. In particular, the course examines how language is intimately tied to place and landscape ("
IRST 343 "Cinema in Quebec and Ireland " "This course offers a comparative study of Quebec and Ireland’s cinema. As cultures, Quebec and Ireland share a history of Catholicism, a relationship with British colonialism, anxiety around language, and unresolved debates about nationalism and state formation. But these points of contact are problematic. This course teases out the complexities and importance of some of these points of contact and divergence so as to engage, in a fully realized way, in a comparative analysis."
IRST 344 "Classics of Irish Theatre " "This course traces a colourful history from the mid-19th century to the present, exploring, amongst other works, the melodramas of Dionysius Boucicault; the pithy plays of Oscar Wilde; the arguably propagandistic work of WB Yeats and Augusta Gregory; the existentialism of Samuel Beckett; the Hiberno-Greek tragedies of Marina Carr; and the Tarantino inspired comedies of Martin McDonagh. Illuminating the politics — national, postcolonial, gendered and global — present in Irish theatre, this course shows that when theatre holds a mirror up to the Irish nation, a wider world is reflected back."
IRST 346 "Irish Performance Studies " "Contemporary Irish culture and identity are associated with various images and forms of behaviour. With the aim of exploring contemporary Irish identity in our globalized era, this course examines performances of Irishness — from Montreal’s St. Patrick’s Day to alternative queer beauty pageants in Dublin, from history-making Irish political speeches to modern day street protests — and addresses questions of cultural identity, cultural authenticity and cultural evolution."
IRST 347 "Contemporary Irish Theatre " "This course offers a panorama of Ireland’s vibrant contemporary theatre landscape. It puts the exciting experimental developments of recent years under the spotlight, engaging with Irish drama that blurs the line between reality and fiction, that immerses its audiences in morally challenging worlds, and that pushes the boundaries of theatre as a medium. From the collectively devised works of Charabanc to Verbatim plays about the Northern Irish troubles, from activist theatre to street theatre, this course explores what happens when theatremakers step outside of conventional spaces and working methods to make art for our mediatized, technologized and globalized era."
IRST 354 "Irish Children’s and Young Adult Literature " "This course examines the figure of the child and the teenager in Irish culture through an exploration of Irish children’s literature, texts written for adults such as Patrick McCabe’s The Butcher Boy, and Irish films that focus on childhood. By focusing on a variety of genres, Irish childhood is explored from a range of perspectives such as the importance of the mythological and fantastic tradition on conceptions of the child and childhood, the significance of place and landscape, the gendering of Irish childhood, and the rise of young adult literature, as well as questions of sexuality, ethnicity, globalization, nostalgia, and national identity."
IRST 371 "Irish Cultural Traditions in Quebec " "Music, song, and dance have consistently acted as conduits for the integration of the Irish immigrants into Québécois society. This interdisciplinary course explores the history of Irish traditional music in Quebec since the 18th century. Using archive recordings, ballads, and dance music, the course traces the history of Irish settlement in Quebec, and focuses specifically on the diaspora of Irish music makers to the province. In exploring this eclectic soundscape, particular emphasis is given to Irish music communities in rural and urban Quebec, from the Gaspé through Quebec City and Montreal, to the Gatineau and Ottawa Valleys."
IRST 373 "Irish Traditional Music in Canada: A Cultural History " "The cultural history of Irish traditional music in Canada is inextricably linked to a matrix of Irish immigration and settlement that began in the late 1600s and that stretched from Newfoundland to the Yukon, from Hudson Bay to the Great Lakes, evidenced in music played by Irish, French, Scottish, and First Nation communities across Canada today. Exploring the music history of the Irish in the Atlantic provinces, Lower and Upper Canada, and the Western provinces, this course draws on analytical models in history, anthropology, and cultural studies, as well as ethnomusicology and music criticism."

Possible memory case studies include the 1641 Rebellion; the Williamite War; the 1798 Rising; the Great Famine; the First World War and the events of the Irish Revolution; the Northern Irish “Troubles”; and Church-State institutional abuse in independent Ireland."
IRST 412 "Rebellions in Ireland and the Canadas " "Prerequisite: IRST 210 and 211; or permission of the Department. This seminar explores the traditions of rebellion that strikingly marked the histories of Ireland and Canada. The Irish Rising of 1798 and the 1837-38 Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada involved class struggles, religious tensions, and attempts to define the democratic futures of both nations. Through a variety of readings about the rebellions, students explore their similarities and differences, consider their respective historiographical controversies, investigate the transatlantic links that existed between Irish and Canadian insurrectionists, and reflect upon each rebellion’s historical legacy."
