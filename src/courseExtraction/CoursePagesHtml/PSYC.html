<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br>
<br>
Psychology is the scientific study of mental life, both its neurological bases and its manifestations in behaviour. Psychology also examines the factors that promote change in behaviour and mental activity. Through teaching and research, the Department serves the community by furthering such knowledge and applying it to promote human welfare. The commitment of faculty members to research assures that students keep up with current developments. Their involvement in community programs keeps students and faculty alike in close touch with the practical application of the discipline.</p>
<hr>

<p><b><a name="programs" id="programs"></a>Programs</b><br>
<br>
The Department of Psychology offers minor, major, specialization, and honours programs. Both BA and BSc degrees are offered, and students may also choose a Behavioural Neuroscience option for these degrees. Students planning a career or graduate studies in psychology are normally expected to follow the appropriate honours or specialization program. Students planning to pursue graduate studies in clinical psychology should ensure that the course electives they choose coincide with requirements of the licensing boards. The major program is designed for students who wish to concentrate their studies in psychology but at the same time wish to pursue general education in other disciplines. The major program can be combined with a major in another department.<br>
Students registered in the Honours, Specialization, or Major in Psychology may select Psychology electives in various Content Areas in order to obtain a broad overview of the discipline. The five Content Areas within the Department are Social, Personality, and Culture; Developmental; Clinical and Health; Behavioural Neuroscience; and Cognitive Science. It is possible for students to pursue in-depth studies within these specific Content Areas by taking Tier 2 courses.<br>
The minor program can be taken only by students registered in another degree program and provides the opportunity to gain basic exposure to the main sub-disciplines of psychology or to pursue one such area in some depth.<br>
Students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of academic counselling services available in the Department of Psychology in order to select the program and courses that best meet their needs. Students are ultimately responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements.<br>

<b>PSYC 200<i>Introductory Psychology</i></b> (6 credits)<br>
This comprehensive survey course introduces the student to a wide variety of topics in scientific psychology. Topics include the foundations of modern psychology, neural mechanisms, learning and memory, sensation and perception, motivation and emotion, cognitive processes, social influences, personality, disorders of cognition and behaviour, and therapy.<br>

<br>
<b>PSYC 210<i>Critical Thinking in Psychology</i></b> (3 credits)<br>
This course provides an innovative approach to understanding how psychologists think about the mind and behaviour, ask and answer questions, and collect and interpret evidence to clarify ideas and test hypotheses. Students learn the difference between critical thinking and gullibility. Students also develop skills to identify errors and misrepresentations in information presented in the media and in viewpoints driven by agendas rather than evidence.<br>
<i>NOTE: Students registered in a Psychology program may not take this course for credit.</i><br>
<br>
<b>PSYC 221<i>Foundations of Personality </i></b>(3 credits)<br>
The organization, functioning, and development of personality are discussed from the point of view of the major current theories. Evidence from empirical studies is introduced to illustrate various influences on personality. Socio-economic, cultural, and biological factors may also be considered.<br>
<i>NOTE: Students registered in a Psychology program may not take this course for credit.</i><br>
<br>
<b>PSYC 222<i>Person and Society </i></b>(3 credits)<br>
This course considers current personality and social psychology research as it relates to peoples everyday lives. The focus is on blending these two research areas. The study of personality concerns itself with the psychology of the individual, individual differences, and the role of individual-level factors in explaining behaviour. In contrast, social psychology focuses on how behaviour may be influenced by social and contextual factors. Topics may include the many ways of describing the self and others, persuasion, group processes, close relationships, aggression, and prosocial behaviour.<br>
<i>NOTE: Students registered in a Psychology program may not take this course for credit.</i><br>
<br>
<b>PSYC 223<i>Motivation and Emotion in Daily Life </i></b>(3 credits)<br>
Why do individuals do the things they do? Why dont individuals do the things they dont do? When confronted with challenges, what determines whether individuals persist in the face of difficulty or decide to invest their energy elsewhere? This course presents models that address the question of why individuals do the things they do. These models are related to specific topics such as appetitive behaviour, love and sexual behaviour, arousal and attention, peak performance, aggression and anger, conflict, stress, curiosity, creativity, goal-setting, and achievement.<br>

<i>NOTE: Students registered in a Psychology program may not take this course for credit.</i><br>
<br>
<b>PSYC 242<i>Psychology and the Law </i></b>(3 credits)<br>
Psychology and the law interact in myriad ways. The criminal justice system, from its code to its enforcement, is based on implicit psychological assumptions about human behaviour and how it should be controlled. Those in the justice system make decisions based on evidence from observations and testimony, both of which are assumed to be gathered in an objective, unbiased manner. Those in psychological professions assume they can influence decisions made in the legal system by providing experimental evidence. This course examines the roles psychologists play in the legal system, the assumptions of both legal and psychological professional groups, and how these groups can complement one another.<br>
